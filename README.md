# MusicLibrayManagementSystem
This is a high school project developed to automate the functionalities of a user friendly music database. The purpose of this software project is to write a program which provides a user friendly interface to explore songs from Apple Music. 

The program mainly brings forth the usage of python programming along with database management system of mySQL. The program was made to work over a network and provide unlimited ways of interaction between the user and the store, some of which are demonstrated in this project in the form of the output.

The mySQL database mainly consists of the track name, artist name, length of the song, energy, beats per minute, danceability, liveness, and popularity. Python program works to connect with the mySQL database to give the user the ability to filter out specific songs (on the basis of artists, tracks etc.) or to make playlists (add, delete, search) as per their needs.
